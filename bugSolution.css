The solution involves using the `box-sizing` property. By setting `box-sizing: border-box;`, the padding is included within the element's total width, resolving the unexpected width calculation.

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 20px);
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
Setting `box-sizing: border-box;` ensures that the padding is accounted for within the element's specified width. Therefore, the 20px padding is deducted from the 50% width that the element would be, resulting in a more accurate width calculation.
